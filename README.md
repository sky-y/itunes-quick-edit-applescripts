itunes-quick-edit-applescripts
==============================

Provides quick change of your song's rate and comment in iTunes.
I recommend to use Spark app to bind scripts to your preferred keys.

## Scripts

Edit Comments.scpt
: You can edit the comment of the selected song in popup dialog

Rate ★(to ★★★★★ and ☆☆☆☆☆).scpt
: Change the rate of the selected song to the specific ★s


## How to Use

1. Recommended: Download [Spark](http://www.shadowlab.org/Software/spark.php) app
	* It can bind applescripts or many actions to hotkeys.
2. Put the applescripts into `~/Library/Scripts/`
3. Open Applescript Editor (`/Applications/Utilities/AppleScript Editor.app`) and
	1. Go to Preferences (with key `command-,`)
	2. Go to General Tab
	3. Check "Show script menu in menu bar" on
4. Open iTunes and try scripts
5. If the scripts work well bind scripts with Spark. Instrctions are:
